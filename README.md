# GridConnect: A Distributed Renewable Energy Grid
A distributed renewable energy grid that allows you to track, manage, and view energy sources and generation from sources such as solar and wind energy, as well as usage of the energy. Made during the Peel StemFest 2021 hackathon.

## Intro & Purpose
As the world starts to realize the harm caused by relying on fossil fuels, it has become ever so important to leave the past and embrace renewable energy sources. However, because there are many types of renewable energy sources, it is important to unite all of these systems on a united platform. That's where GridConnect comes in.

## Features
### Planned
- Raspberry Pi nodes that collect data on the energy usage of invdividual houses, and neighbourhoods
    - Records trends in energy usage
    - Software would run on python
    - Would use Firebase Firestore to store data
- Raspberry Pi nodes that collect data on the energy generation of individual solar panel systems / wind turbines
    - Monitors status, generation efficiency, current generation amount, etc.
    - Software would run on python
    - Would use Firebase Firestore to store data
- Website to summarize collected data in a modern and easy to understand format
    - Would use FERN stack (Firebase Firestore, Express.js, React, Node.js)
    - Displays info in a simple fashion that can be easily read
    - Allow for status checks on energy generation
